A majority element means:
an element that appears more than half of the size of the list.

If it exists → return it.
If it doesn’t → return "No majority element".

Example Input:
nums = [3, 3, 4, 2, 3, 3, 5]


List length = 7
Half = 3.5 → so majority means count > 3.5 → so count ≥ 4

Here:

3 appears 4 times → majority element = 3

Expected Output:
3
